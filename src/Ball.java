/*
This class is in charge of the ball object. The multiple methods in this class handle collision with the upper and lower
window bounds, as well as collision with the paddles. Additionally, there is code that enhances gameplay by making the
ball move faster as the game goes on and sends the ball in a random direction at each "kick-off".

Note: The following code was consulted in the making of this class for some format and conceptual reference.
